# Transformative AI safety working group at Stanford

## Purpose

By "transformative AI", we mean "roughly and conceptually, AI that precipitates a transition comparable to (or more significant than) the agricultural or industrial revolution" (quoting from the [Open Philanthropy Project blog](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/some-background-our-views-regarding-advanced-artificial-intelligence#Sec1) -- see also the more detailed definition #2 in that post).

## Background reading

A recommended background reading list can be found [here](http://shlegeris.com/ai-safety-reading-list).  Also recommended are [80000 Hours podcast episodes](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/) on topics related to transformative AI.
